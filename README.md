# Internship Candidate Finder

Final project of my Object Oriented Programming discipline.

## Scenario

This project deal with the following scenario:

A trainee program (internships) that maintains a list of Universities, each with its location
(address, district, city and state), its Courses (name, acronym, area) and Students enrolled in
each course with their name, enrollment, date of birth, year of enrollment and situation. The
system must allow maintaining of the records of Students, Courses and Universities (insert, update,
search and delete) and allow users to search for possible candidates for internship vacancies as
follows: given a state, a city and a course or a area, show Students enrolled in each University,
showing Student data (including year of enrollment) and Course data, for decision-making.

Note: consider that a Student can only be enrolled in 1 course.
